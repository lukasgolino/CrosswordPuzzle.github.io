<h1> Crossword!! </h1>
<p> Welcome to your present! </p>
 <p>It's a three-parter (kind of)</p>
 <p>First you can enjoy the crossword, and test whether you remember our holidays as well as you think!</p> 
 <p>Then, if you complete it before 18th January 2020 14:00 you will get to unlock your "experience," (and if not I guess I wasted the money!)</p>
 <p>And finally the domain "abigailrichards.co.uk" is regestered for at least 1 year so you get to keep the domain for your own personal website (which I might help you set up if you want one). I was going to just buy a random name like "SolveThePuzzle.com" but thought that would be a waste because you might actually use this one!</p>
 
 <p>Anyway, good luck! I hope it's not too difficult or too easy, and hope you enjoy the pictures and memories! A couple of tips before you begin:</p>
 
 <ul>
 <li> This crossword will work better on PC but can be done on mobile. </li>
 <li> For some reason the links won't open when clicked normally so you have to middle-click or right-click/hold and select "open in new tab"</li>
 <li> Sometimes it's a little unresponsive so you might accidentally skip a letter sometimes (not sure why this happens!) just go back and type it in again.</li>
 <li>0 hints = 20 points, 1 hint = 18 points, 2 hints = 14 points, 3 hints = 12 points, 4-5 hints = 10 points, and 6-9 hints = 8 points. (5 and 7 don't count and are free hints, obviously. Also you'll have to track how many you use yourself because I don't know how to program that yet haha...) Be honest!</li>
 <li> Good luck! </li>
 </ul>
